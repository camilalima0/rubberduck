Next steps:
Integrate with Correios API
Integrate with PagBank API
Plan database tables with all the required data, because I'm not sure if I'll be able to change the tables then
Build the database and implement
Integrate the database to front-end, Idk if it's better using python or JS (search about React) 

Database Tables:
Costumers (ID, Name, Cellphone, Email, Password, Cart, Last_Purchases, Address [St_Av, Neighbourhood, Postal_Code, Number, Compelement, City, State, Country])

Last action: search about API Rastro from Correios, then the user would fill the postal code field and the other fields would be automatically filled. if it doesn't work, do it basic and follow the other steps. if there's a way to do it better, I'll check it then.
